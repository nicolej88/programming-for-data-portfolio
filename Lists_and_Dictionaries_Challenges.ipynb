    "There are three ways to extend a list in Python:  \n",
    "*  use `list_name.append(item)`, `list_name.insert(item)`\n",
    "*  concatenate two lists using the + operator (e.g. new_list = list1 + list2)\n",
    "*  use `list1_name.extend(list2_name)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The last method allows us to add all the `list2` items onto `list1` and for the new, extended list to now be `list1`.  `list2` will always be added to the end of `list1`.  \n",
